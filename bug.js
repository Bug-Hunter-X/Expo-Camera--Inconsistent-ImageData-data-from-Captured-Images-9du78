This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom image processing.  The issue arises when attempting to access pixel data from a captured image using `ImageData.data`.  The data array is unexpectedly empty or contains incorrect values, leading to unexpected visual results or crashes. This often happens when processing images taken in certain lighting conditions or with specific camera settings. The problem isn't consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging. It seems to be related to the asynchronous nature of the Camera API and potential race conditions in accessing the image data before it's fully processed.
