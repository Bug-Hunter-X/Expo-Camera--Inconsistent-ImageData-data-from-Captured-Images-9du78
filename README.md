# Expo Camera ImageData Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API to process captured images.  The issue involves the `ImageData.data` array sometimes being unexpectedly empty or containing incorrect values. This inconsistency makes debugging challenging, and the root cause appears to be a race condition related to the asynchronous nature of the API.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
4. Capture images under various lighting conditions and observe the output. The issue may manifest inconsistently.

## Solution

The provided solution utilizes asynchronous operations to ensure the `ImageData.data` is accessed only after it's fully populated.  Asynchronous operations correctly handle the timing of the data loading process.
